# Development Guide

## Code Style and Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Use meaningful and descriptive variable/function names that clearly indicate their purpose
- Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., `userName`, `calculateTotal`)
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces (e.g., `UserService`, `DatabaseConnection`)
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `API_BASE_URL`)
- Prefix boolean variables with 'is', 'has', 'should', etc. (e.g., `isActive`, `hasPermission`)

### Code Organization
- Keep files focused and single-responsibility
- Group related functionality into modules/services
- Use meaningful directory structure to organize code
- Keep files under 300 lines when possible
- Use clear file naming that reflects the content

### Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear intent
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Keep functions small and focused (ideally under 20 lines)
- Reduce code duplication by extracting common functionality
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Handle errors appropriately with try-catch blocks

### TypeScript Specific
- Use strict type checking
- Avoid using `any` type when possible
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use enums for fixed sets of values
- Leverage TypeScript's type inference when possible

### Testing
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### Error Handling
- Use proper error types
- Include meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle async errors properly
- Don't swallow exceptions without good reason

### Performance
- Optimize database queries
- Use appropriate data structures
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Avoid unnecessary computations
- Monitor memory usage

### Security
- Never store sensitive data in code
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Documentation
- Keep README up to date
- Document API endpoints
- Include setup instructions
- Document environment variables
- Add inline documentation for complex logic

### Version Control
- Write clear commit messages
- Use feature branches
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Review code before merging
- Keep the main branch stable

### Code Review Guidelines
- Review for functionality and correctness
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Ensure proper error handling
- Verify test coverage
- Look for code smells and anti-patterns

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Run tests: `npm test`

## Common Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run test`: Run tests
- `npm run lint`: Run linter
- `npm run format`: Format code

Remember: These guidelines are meant to be followed while maintaining flexibility for specific use cases. Use your judgment and adapt these practices to your specific needs.
